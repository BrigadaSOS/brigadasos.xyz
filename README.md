# Brigada SOS Website

Created with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and deployed with
[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Install

```bash
npm run install
```

## Build

For a watch server that gets hot-reloaded automatically, useful for writing docs:

```bash
npm run start
```

To build and serve a local copy of the page (same as the production environment)

```bash
npm run build && npm run server
```

## Deploy

Commits deployed to `main` branch will get automatically deployed to the main website by Cloudflare
Pages. Use Pull Requests for proposing and previewing changes before merging directly.
